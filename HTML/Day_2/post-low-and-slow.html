    <h1><b>Low and Slow</b></h1>

In <cite>sous vide</cite> cooking, you submerde the food(usually vacuum sealed in plastic) into a wter bath thar is aprecisele set to the target temperature you want the food to be cooked to. In his book, <cite>Cooking fir Geeks</cite>, Jeff Potter describes ir as <q> ultra-low temperature poaching</q>.</p>
